Note that this file is a ROBOT template, and can, in principle, be extended to include any axioms you like. Before extending the template, however, read the following carefully.</p> <p>The main purpose of the custom import template is to enable the management off all terms to be imported in a centralised place. To enable that, you do not have to do anything other than maintaining the template. So if you, say currently import <code>APOLLO_SV:00000480</code>, and you wish to import <code>APOLLO_SV:00000532</code>, you simply add a row like this:</p> <pre><code>ID  Entity Type\nID  TYPE\nAPOLLO_SV:00000480  owl:Class\nAPOLLO_SV:00000532  owl:Class\n</code></pre> <p>When the imports are refreshed see imports refresh workflow, the term(s) will simply be imported from the configured ontologies.</p> <p>Now, if you wish to extend the Makefile (which is beyond these instructions) and add, say, synonyms to the imported terms, you can do that, but you need to (a) preserve the <code>ID</code> and <code>ENTITY</code> columns and (b) ensure that the ROBOT template is valid otherwise, see here.</p> <p>WARNING. Note that doing this is a widespread antipattern (see related issue). You should not change the axioms of terms that do not belong into your ontology unless necessary - such changes should always be pushed into the ontology where they belong. However, since people are doing it, whether the OBO Foundry likes it or not, at least using the custom imports module as described here localises the changes to a single simple template and ensures that none of the annotations added this way are merged into the base file.  </p>"},{"location":"odk-workflows/UpdateImports/#refresh-imports","title":"Refresh imports","text":"<p>If you want to refresh the import yourself (this may be necessary to pass the travis tests), and you have the ODK installed, you can do the following (using go as an example):</p> <p>First, you navigate in your terminal to the ontology directory (underneath src in your hpo root directory).  <pre><code>cd src/ontology\n</code></pre></p> <p>Then, you regenerate the import that will now include any new terms you have added.

The idea is to only import axioms from ontologies that actually belong to it.  A base file is a subset of the ontology that only contains those axioms that nominally  belong there. In other words, the base file does not contain any axioms that belong to another ontology. An example would be this:</p> <p>Imagine this being the full Uberon ontology:</p> <pre><code>Axiom 1: BFO:123 SubClassOf BFO:124\nAxiom 1: UBERON:123 SubClassOf BFO:123\nAxiom 1: UBERON:124 SubClassOf UBERON 123\n</code></pre> <p>The base file is the set of all axioms that are about UBERON terms:</p> <pre><code>Axiom 1: UBERON:123 SubClassOf BFO:123\nAxiom 1: UBERON:124 SubClassOf UBERON 123\n</code></pre> <p>I.e.</p> <pre><code>Axiom 1: BFO:123 SubClassOf BFO:124\n</code></pre> <p>Gets removed.</p> <p>The base file pipeline is a bit more complex than the normal pipelines, because of the logical interactions between the imported ontologies. This is solved by _first  merging all mirrors into one huge file and then extracting one mega module from it.</p> <p>Example: Let's say we are importing terms from Uberon, GO and RO in our ontologies. When we use the base pipelines, we</p> <p>1) First obtain the base (usually by simply downloading it, but there is also an option now to create it with ROBOT) 2) We merge all base files into one big pile 3) Then we extract a single module <code>imports/merged_import.owl</code></p> <p>The first implementation of this pipeline is PATO, see https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato/blob/master/src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml.</p> <p>To check if your ontology uses this method, check src/ontology/life-stages-odk.yaml to see if <code>use_base_merging: TRUE</code> is declared under <code>import_group</code></p> <p>If your ontology uses Base Module approach, please use the following steps: </p> <p>First, add the term to be imported to the term file associated with it (see above \"Using term files\" section if this is not clear to you)</p> <p>Next, you navigate in your terminal to the ontology directory (underneath src in your hpo root directory).  <pre><code>cd src/ontology\n</code></pre></p> <p>Then refresh imports by running</p> <p><pre><code>sh run.sh make imports/merged_import.owl\n</code></pre> Note: if your mirrors are updated, you can run <code>sh run.sh make no-mirror-refresh-merged</code></p> <p>This requires quite a bit of memory on your local machine, so if you encounter an error, it might be a lack of memory on your computer.
