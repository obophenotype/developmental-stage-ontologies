comment: There is little information on the longevity of platypuses. They can live up to 12 years in the wild (see http://www.mspca.org/programs/wildlife-resources/species-information/about-platypuss.html) and one captive specimen was at least 22.6 years old when it died (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Ornithorhynchus_anatinus).
