comment: Bovine gestation is 277 days (about 9 months) (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Bos_taurus). Depending on the breed, the gestation time slightly varies (see http://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php?title=Bovine_Development). Gestational length is commonly calculated based on recorded insemination (see PMID:30452469), so actually this is the fetal age.
