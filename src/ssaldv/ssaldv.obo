comment: approximately 4- 5 weeks after hatching the young fish makes its way through the gravel and begins active feeding. At this point they are approximately 3 inches long and are called "fry" or fingerlings. One year after hatching the fry change coloring and acquire distinctive markings on their flanks which now distinguishes them as "parr". [http://www.uky.edu/~agrdanny/flyfish/life.htm]

comment: dedicated to PMID:32293070; developmentally it makes sense to consider fry before feeding as a category. At least, when the yolk sac is depleted they are considered as at the fry stage. They fed then after that in experiments. They could feed before in the wild of course, so not completely tied to developmental stage, but a common point of difference the feeding (source: discussion with G.Gillard, https://github.com/garethgillard).
