def: "Pig developmental stage that covers the period from 2 months old, when individuals wean, until about 11 months old, when individuals reach sexual maturity." [Bgee:curator]
comment: Pig reach sexual maturity by 768 days of age for male, 334 days for female. While achieving sexual maturity much earlier, males do not typically mate until they are about 5 years old (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Sus_scrofa).
