comment: This stage actually starts at about 3.5 years, the age of sexual maturity. See 3-year-old immature stage and 3-year-old mature stage. The females of this species reach menopause at about the age of 25 (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Macaca_mulatta). We decided to consider this age as the upper limit for adulthood stage, before geriatric age.
