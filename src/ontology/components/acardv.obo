comment: Following internal fertilization, early embryogenesis clearly proceeds within the oviduct in lizards genus Anolis, and most eggs are laid at the Early limb-bud stage of development (Stage 4). Juvenile lizards genus Anolis hatch with a snout-to-vent length of about 1.6 cm, after 22-27 days of incubation(see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17724661).

comment: Green anoles have a lifespan ranging from 2 to 8 years, determined largely by predation. Lifespan in captivity is similar to that in the wild, approximately 4 to 6 years (see http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Anolis_carolinensis/). We arbitraly consider 2 years as the upper limit for the adult stage, before aged stage. This is to improve as far as information is available.

comment: Green anoles can live up to seven years in captivity (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Anolis_carolinensis). We arbitraly consider over 2 years as the starting point for aged stage. This is to improve as far as information is available.
