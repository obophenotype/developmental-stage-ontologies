comment: Male and female horse reach sexual maturity in different ages: 973 days post-birth for females and 914 days post birth for males (http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Equus_caballus). Thus, we arbitrary set the boundary between immature and mature stages to 943 days old, i.e. 2.6 years (mean value of male and female maturity).
