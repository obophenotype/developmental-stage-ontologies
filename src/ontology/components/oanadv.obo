def: "Mature stage that refers to a adult platypus which is over 1.5 and under 10 years old, the usual upper limit for breeding age." [Bgee:curator "Bgee"]
comment: Females are thought likely to become sexually mature in their second year, with breeding confirmed still to take place in animals over 9 years old. (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platypus). We decided to consider 10 years the upper limit for breeding age, before aged stage.

comment: There is little information on the longevity of platypuses. They can live up to 12 years in the wild (see http://www.mspca.org/programs/wildlife-resources/species-information/about-platypuss.html) and one captive specimen was at least 22.6 years old when it died (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Ornithorhynchus_anatinus). Over 10 years old is usually no more a breeding age.
