comment: Embryo develops in 155 days (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Capra_hircus). Bgee_curator_notes: Bgee prenatal stage definition differs from Uberon embryonic stage definition by the notion of birth for stage ending, while Uberon ends with fully formed embryo. We maybe have to correct our too precise definition.

comment: On the 6th day after fertilization the goat embryo shows structural changes indicative of transformation into a blastocyst. At this time the central embryonic cells exhibit signs of strong growth, and the blastocyst cavity begins to form, see https://zootechnical.com/article/148044/en.

comment: Further embryonic development involves the disappearance of the zona pellucida, rapid growth and development of the blastulas, and the formation of the germ layer, i.e. gastrulation. In this form the embryo is implanted in the wall of the uterus, where subsequent stages of embryonic development take place. The endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm formed during gastrulation form most of the organs and tissues, see https://zootechnical.com/article/148044/en.

comment: Goat reach sexual maturity by 685 days of age for male (22 months), 406 days for female (13 months), see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Capra_hircus. We arbitrary define the limit of the immature stage to 18 months.
