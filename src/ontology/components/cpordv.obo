comment: Male and female cavy reach sexual maturity in different ages: 66 days post-birth for females and 76 days post birth for males (http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Cavia_porcellus). Thus, we arbitrary set the boundary between immature and mature stages to 71 days old (mean value of male and female maturity).
