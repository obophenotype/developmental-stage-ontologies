comment: Embryo develops in 146 days (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Ovis_aries). Bgee_curator_notes: Bgee prenatal stage definition differs from Uberon embryonic stage definition by the notion of birth for stage ending, while Uberon ends with fully formed embryo. We maybe have to correct our too precise definition.
